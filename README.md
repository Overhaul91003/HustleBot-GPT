🚀 What is an RAG Chatbot?
HustleBot-GPT is built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a technique that enhances a chatbot’s responses by retrieving relevant information from external sources before generating answers. This means:

✅ It takes user prompts and interacts with ChatGPT to maintain a natural conversation flow.
✅ It fine-tunes its responses on specific topics—startups and funding trends in this case.
✅ It stays up-to-date by pulling the latest startup-related data from curated sources.
